    The logger will be initialized if it has not been initialized. By default a
    StreamHandler will be added. If `log_file` is specified, a FileHandler will
    also be added. The name of the root logger is the top-level package name,
    e.g., "mmpose".

    Args:
        log_file (str | None): The log filename. If specified, a FileHandler
            will be added to the root logger.
        log_level (int): The root logger level. Note that only the process of
            rank 0 is affected, while other processes will set the level to
            "Error" and be silent most of the time.

    Returns:
        logging.Logger: The root logger.
